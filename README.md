## Overview

This repository contains notes and preliminary results exploring a geometric approach to the Riemann Hypothesis based on the log-potential of the completed ξ-function.

The focus is on symmetry, equilibrium conditions, and field-like interpretations that may enforce the critical line as a unique locus for nontrivial zeros.

This work is exploratory and intended for open scrutiny.
