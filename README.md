# riemann-log-potential-geometry
Geometric analysis of the Riemann ξ-function via log-potential fields. This repository documents an independent investigation into whether symmetry and gradient structure of log|ξ(s)| enforce the critical line as a unique equilibrium locus, offering a geometric approach to the Riemann Hypothesis.
